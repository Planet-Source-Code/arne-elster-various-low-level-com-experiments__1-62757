## various low level COM experiments

### Description

Due to some sort of misunderstanding this got removed last time, so here it is again...

We all know, VB is full of automation.

Every object, every array, every string.

But VB does an excellent job in hiding all this from us.

Here are 3 projects: 1) create any interfaces without type libs 2) show/manipulate safearrays, create any 1D arrays from pointers 3) the interesting ITypeInfo, which will let you enumerate all memebers of an object/interface (that's roughly what TLBINF32.dll does)
